# Capstone Project

## Project Schedule

## Project Description
### The country information app that I am creating will have three components. The HomeComponent will show the top three countries under various categories. Like population, GDP, and area. You will be able to click the name of each country to read more about it. The additional information about the country is listed using another component, which I will be named the CountryDetailComponent. There will be one more component in the app, which will be used to display a list of all the countries that we have stored in our app.
